## Intro

The repository serves as a personal archive of all code written during the course of Data Programming at UP FAMNIT. The code is written in Python or R, using VS Code and R Studio as the IDEs.

**!!! Code in this repository is a wild mix of genius and "oopsie doopsies" - it‚Äôs shared !!! after !!! submitting my assignments, so expect adventures (and bugs). Use or copy at your risk !!!**

**FOR "I AM THE SMARTEST IDIOT" CLASSMATE(S): this IS NOT a free ride for your homework. When you get caught using my gigabrain, I'll proudly wave this repository, timestamps, hidden indicators, as proof of my originality while you get a front-row seat to your ethics hearing. Consider yourself warned üíÖ**
